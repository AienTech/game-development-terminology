# Game Dev Terminology

There were a lot of words that I was unfamiliar with, as I started to learn game development.

So I decided to create my own "dictionary" to use as a reference for
learning and making this path easier.

Then I thought, why not make this open-source so anyone out there, who
has similar issues would benefit from having this?

Therefore I made the decision to make this "terminology" open for everyone.

# How can I use it?

If you don't want to compile the latex files and also don't want to
make changes for the future, just download the [Main PDF](https://github.com/AienTech/gaming-development-terminology/raw/main/main.pdf) file and
enjoy it.

# Is there a release for this project?

The plan is that I release a new version each time we pass 100 words.

# Can I share it with some one else?

Yes, this project is licensed under the Creative Commons By 4.0. For more info take a look at [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

# Can I also contribute?

Of course! and I will be very happy to have you as a contributor to
this project

## How can I contribute?

It's pretty much easy and straightforward, just do your changes and send
me a PR, I'll do a review and then it's done.

## What do I have to consider for contribution?

Well, you need to have some understandings of game development and also
UE4, or at least Unity engine. After you did your contribution,
don't forget to add you name, email and Twitter (or GitHub) handle to
the `pages/contributors.tex`. For which there's a command available
`\contributor{[Your name]}{[Your email]}{[Your Twitter handle]}{[Your Github handle]}`
