\section{Preface}

There were a lot of words that I was unfamiliar with, as I started to learn game development.

So I decided to create my own "dictionary" to use as a reference for
learning and making this path easier.

Then I thought, why not make this open-source so anyone out there, who
has similar issues would benefit from having this?

Therefore I decided to make this "terminology" open for everyone.

For this terminology, I'm using different sources. These sources may include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unreal engine 4 official documentation
	\item Unreal engine 4 official forums
	\item Wikipedia
	\item Autodesk
	\item Unity engine documentation
	\item Stackoverflow
\end{itemize}
