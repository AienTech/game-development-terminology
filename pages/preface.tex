\section{Preface}

There were a lot of words that I was unfamiliar with, as I started to learn game development.

So I decided to create my own "dictionary" to use as a refrence for
learning and making this path easier.

Then I thought, why not make this open source so anyone out there, who
has similar issues would benefit from having this?

Therefore I made the decision to make this "terminology" open for everyone.
