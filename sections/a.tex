\entry{Actor}{
	An Actor is any object that can be 
	placed into a level \ref{Level}. Actors are 
	a generic Class that support 3D transformations such as 
	translation, rotation, and scale. 
	Actors can be created (spawned) and destroyed 
	through gameplay code (C++ or Blueprints \ref{Blueprint}). 
	In C++, AActor is the base class of all Actors.

\entry{AI}{
	Artificial intelligence (AI), 
	is intelligence demonstrated by machines, 
	unlike the natural intelligence displayed 
	by humans and animals.

	Creating Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
	for characters \ref{Character} or other entities in your 
	projects \ref{Project} in Unreal Engine 4 
	(UE4) is accomplished through multiple 
	systems working together. From a Behavior Tree  \ref{Behavior Tree}
	that is branching between different decisions or 
	actions, running a query to get information about 
	the environment through the 
	Environment Query System (EQS) \ref{Environment Query System (EQS)}, 
	to using the AI Perception system \ref{AI Perception System} to retrieve sensory 
	information such as sight, sound, or damage information. 
	all of these systems play a key role in creating believable AI 
	in your projects. Additionally, all of these tools 
	can be debugged with the AI Debugging tools, 
	giving you insight into what the AI is 
	thinking or doing at any given moment. 
}

\entry{AI Perception System}{
	In addition to Behavior Trees \ref{Behavior Tree}
	which can be used to make decisions on which logic 
	to execute, and the 
	Environmental Query System (EQS) \ref{Environment Query System (EQS)} 
	used to retrieve information about the environment; 
	another tool you can use within the AI framework which 
	provides sensory data for an AI \ref{AI} is the AI Perception System. 
	This provides a way for Pawns \ref{Pawn} to receive data 
	from the environment, such as where 
	noises are coming from, if the AI was 
	damaged by something, or if the AI sees 
	something. This is accomplished with the 
	AI Perception Component that acts as a 
	stimuli listener and gathers registered Stimuli Sources.
