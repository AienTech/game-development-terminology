\entry{UV Coordinates}{
	Most mesh \ref{Mesh} formats also support some form of 
	UV-coordinates which are a separate 2d representation of the mesh 
	"unfolded" to show what portion of a 2-dimensional texture map to 
	apply to different polygons \ref{Polygon} of the mesh. 
	It is also possible for meshes to contain another such vertex \ref{Vertex} 
	attribute information such as colour, tangent vectors, 
	weight maps to control animation, etc 
	(sometimes also called channels).
