\entry{Material}{
	A Material is an asset that can be 
	applied to a mesh \ref{Mesh} to control the visual 
	look of the scene. At a high level, it is probably 
	easiest to think of a Material as the "paint" 
	that is applied to an object.

\entry{Mesh}{
	In 3D computer graphics and solid modeling, a polygon mesh is 
	a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the shape 
	of a polyhedral object. The faces usually consist of triangles 
	(triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or other simple convex 
	polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but may also 
	be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons 
	with holes.

	A mesh is consisted of 7 components:
