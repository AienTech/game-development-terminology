\entry{NPC}{
	A non-player character (NPC) is 
	any character \ref{Character} in a game which is 
	not controlled by a player. The term 
	originated in traditional tabletop 
	role-playing games where it applies 
	to characters controlled by the gamemaster 
	or referee rather than another player. 
	In video games, this usually means a character 
	controlled by the computer (instead of the player) 
	that has a predetermined set of behaviors that 
	potentially will impact game play, but not 
	necessarily be true artificial intelligence \ref{AI}.
