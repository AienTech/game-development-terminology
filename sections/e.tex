\entry{Environment Query System (EQS)}{
	The Environment Query System (EQS) is a 
	feature within the Artificial Intelligence \ref{AI} 
	system in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) 
	that is used to collect data from the 
	environment. Within EQS, you can ask questions 
	about the data collected through a variety of 
	different Tests which produces an Item that 
	best fits the type of question asked. 

	An EQS Query can be called from a Behavior Tree \ref{Behavior Tree} 
	and used to make decisions on how to 
	proceed based on the results of your Tests. 
	EQS Queries are primarily made up of Generators \ref{Generator}
	(which are used to produce the locations or Actors that will 
	be tested and weighted) and Contexts \ref{Context} 
	(which are used as a frame of reference for 
	any Tests or Generators). 
	EQS Queries can be used to instruct AI 
	characters \ref{Character} to find the best possible location 
	that will provide a line of sight to a player 
	in order to attack, the nearest health or 
	ammo pickup, or where the closest cover 
	point (among other possibilities).
