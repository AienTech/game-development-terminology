\entry{Ray tracing}{
	Simply put, ray tracing is a 
	technique that makes light in 
	videogames behave like it does in real 
	life. It works by simulating actual 
	light rays, using an algorithm to 
	trace the path that a beam of light 
	would take in the physical world. 
	Using this technique, game designers 
	can make virtual rays of light appear 
	to bounce off objects, cast realistic 
	shadows, and create lifelike reflections.

\entry{Rect light}{
	The Rect Light emits light into the 
	scene from a rectangular plane with 
	a defined width and height. You can use 
	them to simulate any kind of light sources 
	that have rectangular areas, such as televisions 
	or monitor screens, overhead lighting 
	fixtures, or wall sconces.
