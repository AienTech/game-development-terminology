\entry{Object}{
	The base building blocks in the Unreal Engine 
	are called Objects and contain a lot of 
	the essential "under the hood" functionality 
	for your game assets. Just about everything in 
	Unreal Engine 4 inherits (or gets some functionality) 
	from an Object. In C++, UObject is the base class 
	of all objects; it implements features such as 
	garbage collections, metadata (UProperty) support 
	for exposing variables to the Unreal Editor, and 
	serialization for loading and saving.
