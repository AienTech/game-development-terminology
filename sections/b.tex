\entry{Behavior Tree}{
	Behavior Trees assets in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) 
	can be used to create artificial intelligence (AI) \ref{AI} 
	for non-player characters \ref{NPC} in your projects. 
	While the Behavior Tree asset is used to execute 
	branches containing logic, to determine which 
	branches should be executed, the Behavior Tree 
	relies on another asset called a Blackboard \ref{Blackboard} which serves 
	as the "brain" for a Behavior Tree.
}

\entry{Blackboard}{
	A blackboard is a simple place where 
	data can be written and read for decision 
	making purposes. A blackboard can be used 
	by a single AI pawn \ref{Pawn}, shared by a squad, 
	or used for any other purpose where itâ€™s 
	convenient to have a central place to look 
	up relevant data. Blackboards are commonly 
	used with behavior trees, but you could use 
	them separately from behavior trees for 
	convenience or you could make a behavior 
	tree with no need of a blackboard.

\entry{Blueprint}{
	Blueprints is the visual scripting system inside 
	Unreal Engine 4 and is a fast way to start prototyping \ref{Prototype} 
	your game. Instead of having to write code line by line, 
	you do everything visually: drag and drop nodes, set their 
	properties in a UI, and drag wires to connect.
}

\entry{Branch}{
	The Branch node is a switch node \ref{Switch Node} 
	that serves as a simple 
	way to create decision-based 
	flow from a single true/false 
	condition. Once executed, the 
	Branch node looks at the incoming value 
	of the attached Boolean, and outputs an 
	execution pulse down the appropriate output.
