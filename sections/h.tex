\entry{HUD}{
	Heads-up Displays (HUDs) are the games' way 
	of providing information about the game to 
	the player and in some cases allowing the 
	player to interact with the game.

	Unreal Engine 4 provides multiple means of 
	creating UIs \ref{User Interface (UI)} and HUDs. 
	The Canvas class \ref{Canvas} can be used to draw 
	directly to the screen at a low level, overlaid onto the world.
	
	The game's Interface is used to convey 
	information to the player and provide a 
	means of prompting the user for directed 
	input. A game interface generally consists 
	of two main elements: the heads-up display 
	(HUD) and menus or user interfaces (UIs).

\entry{User Interface (UI)}{
	User Interfaces refer to menus and other 
	interactive elements. These elements are 
	usually drawn overlaid on the screen much 
	like the HUD \ref{HUD}, but in certain 
	circumstances they could be part of the 
	game world itself rendered onto a surface \ref{Surface}
	in the world. The most obvious examples of 
	UIs are the main menu displayed when the game 
	starts up or the pause menu shown when the player 
	has paused the game. However, other UIs may be 
	displayed during play. These could be used to 
	show dialog between characters in the game or 
	in more complex situations, such as in an RTS 
	or RPG, they may be integral to the game play \ref{Gameplay Framework}
	itself allowing the player to choose weapons, 
	armor, units to build, etc.
